# BlueLink – IoT Bluetooth Mobile App with Kotlin

**BlueLink** is an Android-first **IoT Bluetooth application** built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.  
It connects, controls, and logs data from one or multiple BLE devices (e.g. physics sensors), while also integrating with embedded firmware to deliver a full end-to-end solution.

## 🌟 Highlights
- **Android-Centric Approach**  
  Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM architecture, Hilt for DI, and Room for data persistence.  
- **Robust BLE Functionality**  
  Supports scanning, connecting, GATT operations, command/response, and live data streaming.  
- **Scalable for Multiple Devices & Experiments**  
  Works with various sensor devices, allows executing different experiment modes (e.g. Photo Gate timing), and recording results.  
- **Embedded Firmware Integration**  
  Developed firmware for the sensor side to support BLE services, command handling, and data transmission.
